This is an example app of Require.js + jQuery + Buster.js

So far, its very touchy.

Problems:
 - Can't use testbed config yet in buster.js [eventual]
 - Use of setting directory as resource trip error [need to report to buster]
 - Require.js is very touchy about things not loaded yet
  - Alternate require syntax is possibly confusing
 - Buster.js does not refresht eh testbed between cases as it is supposed to [need to report to buster]
